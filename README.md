The Matchmakerâ€™s Game is fun game wherein it is 
match of intuiter against the master. MASTER in 
the game has to affix with particular number 
whereas the INTUITER has to guess the number 
asserted by  MASTER. There will be perfect match 
against each other when the NUMBER OF 
TRIALS, MAXIMUM RANGE and  CONTRAST 
IN THE ROLES get matched. If the  INTUITER 
guesses within the number of trials, then he/she 
wins or else MASTER wins. Based on the input 
processed, the game proceeds to run. Each me 
when a user logs into the game, user will be 
connected to the server with unique port number 
securely. Hence the server part of our projects 
serves as intermediary among the clients that is 
Master and Intuiter . When there is no perfect 
match, all the users are logged in and queued un l 
or unless there is a perfect match.  
Intuiter and Master are aliased as Guesser and 
Decider for sake simplicity and understanding. 

FEAUTURES OF PROJECT:  
1. Implemented in Python Programming 
Language using Python Sockets  
2. TCP/IP sockets and TCP data transfer 
protocol.  
3. Utilizes the SSL module to establish an 
SSL/TLS encrypted connection and loads 
certificate files (cert.pem and key.pem) for 
encryption.  
4. Uses threading to handle each client 
connection and game instance concurrently.  
WORKING ON SSL IMPLEMENTATION:  
SSL are essential in data encryption to ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity of data transmitted 
between server and client. As a part of 
implementation, we are incorporating the SSL 
concept to ensure data security while  
communicating.
